name: workflow-plan
description: Runs the plan workflow in Codex. Use when the user explicitly selects workflow-plan.
---

Run this workflow in the main chat. Use only tools exposed by the current host and follow the user’s existing authorization and higher-priority instructions. Installing this skill does not register a custom slash command.

Read the bundled workflows below when required by the procedure. If an installed skill with the same name is available, prefer it; otherwise read the linked local workflow. Resolve every resource relative to the installed skill, not the project working directory. Helpers using <installed-skill-directory> use the directory of that bundled workflow. User arguments are plain task input, never shell code.

## Bundled workflows and personas

- planning-and-task-breakdown: [bundled workflow](references/workflows/planning-and-task-breakdown/SKILL.txt)


Invoke the `planning-and-task-breakdown` skill.

Read the existing spec (SPEC.md or equivalent) and the relevant codebase sections. Then:

1. Enter plan mode — read only, no code changes
2. Identify the dependency graph between components
3. Slice work vertically (one complete path per task, not horizontal layers)
4. Write tasks with acceptance criteria and verification steps
5. Add checkpoints between phases
6. Present the plan for human review

Save the plan to tasks/plan.md and task list to tasks/todo.md.

If tasks/plan.md or tasks/todo.md already exists with unchecked tasks for different work, stop and ask before writing — never silently overwrite an incomplete plan.
